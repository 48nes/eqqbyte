<h5>origin of the moons</h5>
<p>Each of the three moons (Io, Ganymede, and Callisto), were found on the doorstep of various adoption agencies and promptly adopted into various families. Io was adopted into the Yin family and given the name Meghan, Ganymede into the Hsieh family and given the name Virginia, and Callisto into the Jaitly family and given the name Eshani. While the Hsiehs and Jaitlys were neighbors for all of Ganymede and Callisto's lives, Ganymede and Callisto did not cross paths until high school, as Ganymede was sent to a private girl's school.</p>

<h5>discovery of powers</h5>
<p>Each moon lived in relative peace until their 14th birthday, whereupon they each discovered their respective powers. Luckily, each discovered their power in a private area and were thus able to keep their newfound abilities a secret from their parents. During this time, the three attended the same high school, with Io being the new kid in town.</p>

<h5>first meeting</h5>
<p>Io and Callisto were partners for a chemistry project, while Callisto and Ganymede were in the same English class. Despite this, the three did not realize their connection until they were trapped* together somewhat coincidentally during a school field trip. Io used her powers to get the three to safety, upon the other two revealed they, too, had powers.</p>

<h5>formation of team jupiter</h5>
<p>Each Moon received a trinket from a mysterious entity called Jupiter and thus the three decided to be known as Team Jupiter. As each trinket came addressed to their "birth" name, the three began using the names "Io", "Ganymede", and "Callisto" as code names for their various missions.</p>

<p>During the first formation, it was briefly brought up by Callisto that the planet Jupiter had four moons, although nothing came out of their original search for Europa.</p>

<p>The Moons soon began receiving more messages from Jupiter with instructions for various crime-fighting missions. Although they were at first skeptical of how Jupiter was able to determine where sites of crime were happening, this was also quickly disregarded as missions became more frequent (along with difficulties juggling missions and maintaining secret identities).</p>

<h5>meeting europa</h5>
<p>On a particularly difficult mission, the triad runs into Europa for the first time. Despite the three of them working together, they are unable to stop Europa from stealing the artifact they were assigned to procure. While Io asks Europa to join them, Europa remains silent during the entire fight and disappears with the artifact...</p>
