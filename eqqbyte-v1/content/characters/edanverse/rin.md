bio = "Little is known about Rin's family outside of her father's insistence that she attend a Springs Institute. Rin appeared on the steps of the institute as a baby, where she was adopted by one of the teachers there. Due to her asymmetrical horns, many expected Rin to show higher magickal ability, but this never came to fruition. As her adoptive parent was very busy, Rin was given lots of independence which she spent playing hooky with Arya and Jennie. Following her attempt to send Kahn back to Edan, Rin was banished from Diyu by Jennie. Due to a portal malfunction, Rin ended up on the bank of Bet severely injured."
