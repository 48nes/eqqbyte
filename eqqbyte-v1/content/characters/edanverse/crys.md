bio = "Crys was born in a human village in Massu, where they were raised to be a doctor. During her training, Crys discovered a love for biology and mechanics and began working towards creating an almanac of plantlife in Edan. Discontent with staying in Massu, Crys also slowly began building a motor vehicle, which they then used to travel across Massu and, later on, Shivra. During one of their treks into Shivra, Crys was injured due to a motor failure. It was while stranded that Crys first met Alek, who would then introduce them to Thia."
