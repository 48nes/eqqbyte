bio = "Cael was identified as having stronger magickal abilities from a very young age and was taken from her family to become a priestess in Bet. After her training, Cael was given three years time to roam Edan before her contract with the temple stipulated she return. During this time, Cael built a small shelter along the border of Bet and Terres. Due to the Diyese transportation route in Bet, Cael would often encounter Diyese migrants. Towards the end of her three years, Cael encountered both Ten and Rin and, eventually, she was convinced to abandon her duties and stay in Terres."
