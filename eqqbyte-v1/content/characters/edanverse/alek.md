bio = "Alek was born in Shivra near the border of Massu. From a young age, the Hua siblings were allowed to roam free. While his sister preferred to stay closer to their home, by the time Alek was 14, he had already scaled five of Shivra's mountains on his own. After building his own cabin, Alek continued to explore the wildlife of Shivra, letting his sister and Crys inhabit his cabin. During several of his expeditions, Alek would run into Cael, and the two became friends."
