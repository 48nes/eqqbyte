  <h3>the regions</h3>
  <div class="row no-gutters">
    <div class="col-md-7 p-1">
      <p>The Edanverse is a structure of three continents that are stacked on top of each other. At the very top is the floating island of Kumo, which floats in the sky. The surface continent is divided into Edan, the land-based portion, and Dvar, the oceanic region that also serves as a portal to the lower tier. The final continent rests below Edan, and is partitioned into the countries of Diyu and Venere.</p>
      <h5>mythology</h5>
      <p>It is believed across the land that all five regions were the creation of five patron deities: the Sun, the Star, the Sky, the Sea, and the Earth. It is also believed that all magick stems from the five deities and, as a result, each species is protective of their patron deity. While each region and species have different interpretations of what has happened to the five deities since, all acknowledge that the deities no longer exist in Edan, although there are disputes over whether or not they will return/if they ever even truly existed in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>The most popular of the stories of the five Deities saw them as "siblings" of sorts, with the eldest being the Sun, followed by the Earth, the Sea and Sky as twins, and then the Stars. The Sun had lived in solitude until the Universe granted them the Earth and, in the beginning, they had together created Humans.</p>
      <p>The Sun proceeded to create Demons while the Earth created Nymphs. Watching their siblings, the Sky created Demons and the Sea created Nymphs. Not able to choose between their elder siblings, the Stars created both Nymphs and Demons, thus forming the species inhabiting Edan today.</p>
      <p>The story's end generally follows the Sun becoming mad with power and, with great regret, the Earth, Sea, and Sky coming together to seal the Sun in the deepest pits of Diyu. The Stars, unable to bear the schism between their siblings, fled. For the years after, the Earth ruled Edan alone as the Sea and Sky were consumed by grief. Eventually, even the Earth left to wander the cosmos.</p>
      <h5>transportation</h5>
      <p>Transportation between the three layers can be a complicated matter. The most common routes from Diyu and Venere to Edan are through Dvarish detours. Getting to Kumo is only possible through aircrafts, which are highly regulated. However, in recent years, Diyu has begun construction on Teleporters, although the technology is still in early stages and are at high risk of failure.

        <p>For the most part, Diyu is a flat and urbanized region. The land ceded to them by Venere following the Last War are the only mountainous regions in Diyu and, as a result, are primarily inhabited by Star Demons rather than Sun Demons.</p>
        <h5>notable locations</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>U'du, the capital of Diyu and where 90% of the populations lives in apartment-like complexes.</li>
          <li>Marianne/Maa'lan, ceded Venerian territory. Venerians still refer to the land as Marianne, while Diyu renamed the territory Maa'lan. The Star Demon population is centered here.</li>
          <li>Y'ao, a sister location to the Dvarian Y'ohe</li>
          <li>Injung, one of the larger Diyu cities</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Amity Springs, a gated resort community where Lords and Ladys live.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Springs Institutes, various insitutions across Diyu that act as schools. The number associated with the insittued (i.e. Ten Springs Institute) serves as a reference of how good the school is.</li>
          <li>Engfu, a closed off city where it is said the Noble Families live.</li>
        </ul>
	</div>
      </div>
      <h5>social structures</h5>
      <p>Diyu implements a rigid social hierarchy. At the top of the hierarchy are the Ten Noble Families, with lineages that can be traced all the way back to the era when Deities still existed. However, Noble Families are notoriously reclusive and selective and thus not much is known about them. Due to their reclusive nature, they have, in recent times, become little more than myths themselves.</p>
      <p>Right below the Noble Families are a vast amount of Lordships and Ladyships. This rank applies to wealthier residents of Diyu. Many of these Lordships and Ladyships will own a separate resort on the borders of Diyu rather than residing in the metropolitan area.</p>
      <p>Underneath Lordships and Ladyships are Merchants and Craftsfolk. The most flexible tier, peasants are able to quickly achieve Merchant or Craftsfolk status if they are able to attend school.</p>
      <p>Finally, the lowest tier consists of the peasantry. While many strive to enter the Merchants and Craftsfolk tier, families can often only afford to send one of their children to school.</p>
      <h5>culture and religion</h5>
      <p>Diyu, as a region, is not particularly religious. The region itself does not promote any holidays, although various holidays are still observed by families in private (especially migrant families). The Diyese are considered to be private people.</p>
      <h5>economy</h5>
      <p>Diyu is the lead in manufacturing, technology, and transportation. They are on relatively good terms with all the other regions in terms of trade, although they trade most frequently with Kumo.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="collapse" id="venere" data-bs-parent="#region-parent">

      <div class="row no-gutters">

        <p>Venere is bordered by mountain ranges on the left and Lower Dvar on the right. Although the mountain ranges once were considered Venerian territory, most of the range was ceded to Diyu after the Last War. Still, Venere is the rockiest of the five regions and has the greatest difference between minimum and maximum altitudes.</p>
        <h5>notable locations</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Lume, the capital of Venere. It is the flattest of all the munincipalities. It is not highly populated, but is a popular tourist destination due to the beach.</li>
          <li>Arisii, the most populated munincipality of Venere. The East of Arisii consists of mostly apartment complexes.</li>
          <li>Montfeu, a sister location to what was previously Marianne (see Diyu). Montfeu is almost entirely mountain ranges.</li>
        </ul>
	</div>
      </div>
      <h5>social structures</h5>
      <p>In Venere, habitants exist in "family" clans. Although not all are related to each other, each of the clans exists with their own sets of rules and customs. However, clans are not static and habitants frequently switch clans as a result of marriage, friendships, or simply whim. Each clan does have their own initiation rituals (or lack thereof) for new clan members.</p>
      <p>Due to the annexation of Marianne, in recent years, previous residents of Marianne have split into two camps: while many chose to stay in what is now Maa'lan, some migrated into Montfeu. As a result of this, the border between Maa'lan and Venere often consists of more hierarchial clan systems with some even adhering more to Diyu social customs.</p>
      <h5>culture and religion</h5>
      <p>Venerians love to celebrate, although the reasons for celebration are often not of importance. There are not many regionally celebrated holidays, but Venerians love to host elaborate parties and celebrate achievements.</p>
      <h5>economy</h5>
      <p>Venere is the lead in luxury products, such as diamonds and gold. They also export exotic animals as pets. They trade most frequently with Edan and Diyu, although politically there is still tension with Diyu left over from the Last War. Venere-Kumo relations are even more tense and the two regions have high tariffs on each others' products.</p>

        <p>Dvar is a underwater region that serves as a "portal" between Edan and Diyu/Venere. Spanning both the surface level and lower level, Dvar's main residencies are on the lower level while temples, schools, and businesses exist closer to the surface level. However, following the Last War, Dvar was abandoned and is now essentially a ghost region with very few residents.</p>
        <h5>notable locations</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Apteel, the capital of Dvar</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Upper Level - the upper level of Apteel used to consist of administration buildings.</li>
                <li>Lower Level - the lower level of Apteel used to consist of mansions for wealthier Sea Nymphs.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Serys</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Upper Level - the upper level of Serys was previously the entertainment district, which now hosts many abandoned clubs and shopping plazas</li>
                <li>Lower Level - the lower level of Serys consists of abandoned houses for the general public</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Bet</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Upper Level - the upper level of Bet is one of few Dvarian locations that are still habited. It consists of primarily temples.</li>
                <li>Lower Level - surrounded by Diyu territories, the lower level of Bet was previously used as a trade port between Dvar and Diyu and hosted a variety of housing that other species could access.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Danna, a trade port and one of few Dvarish locations that are still habited.</li>
              <li>Makar, considered a sister location to Bet, consists of mostly temples.</li>
              <li>Y'ohe, the only location that exists only on the lower level, Y'ohe is badly polluted and was previously the poorest part of Dvar. It is a sister location to Y'ao.</li>
            </ul>
	</div>
      </div>
      <h5>social structures</h5>
      <p>Prior to the Last War and the abandonment, Dvar was a democratic society. Divided into sectors by the residential areas, elections and seminars were hosted to make major decisions. Of all the regions, Dvar was the most equal in terms of wealth distribution, although there did exist wealthy Dvarians.</p>
      <h5>culture and religion</h5>
      <p>Comparatively, Dvar was far more religious compared to the other regions. Even in the modern day, despite most regions being abandoned, Dvarian temples are still regularly tended to. There are quite a few Dvarian holidays celebrated, most being related to the Sea Deity.</p>
      <h5>economy</h5>
      <p>Dvar's main exports are seafood and energy, although exports are limited due to Dvar being mostly a ghost zone.</p>

        <p>As Kumo is a sky region, the geography is notably different from all the others. The texture of the ground is described often as cloud-like, although the terrain is mostly grassy.</p>
        <h5>notable locations</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Oma, the capital of Kumo. It is cohabited by Sky Demons and Star Nymphs and is considered the financial capital aside being the political and geographical capital.</li>
              <li>Tari, the Northernmost location. It is much colder than the rest of Kumo and is habited by a few scattered groups of Sky Demons and very few Star Nymphs.</li>
              <li>Paruta, a trade port and military base. It has Kumo's only transportation hub and is the only place Kumoans can travel to other regions from. It is always under high security. </li>
              <li>Rho, a small island habited by almost exclusively Star Nymphs. It is considered the knowledge capital of the world, contained a vast library and various Star Nymph schools. Due to rigid guidelines, the schools are only accessible to Kumoans and even then, it is attended by almost exclusively Star Nymphs.</li>
              <li>Aten, the second most populated location. The population skews more towards Sky Demons, although Star Nymphs also live here. Despite being heavily populated, it is an almost idyllic location.</li>
            </ul>
	</div>
      </div>
      <h5>social structures</h5>
<p>Due to Kumo being closed off from the rest of the regions, the relationship between Kumoans are very tight-knit as they do not often get the ability to travel to other regions. The government is perhaps the most centralized out of all the regions, with the central Kumo Government dictating policies regarding education, travel, healthcare, and housing.</p>
            <p>A central Cabinet decides these policies. The identities of the central Cabinet are kept secret as to limit corruption.</p>
            <p>Kumo generally consists of the nuclear family structure, with 2-3 parental figures, and 2-3 children. Similar to the government, each family unit consists of an authority figure, and children are raised from a young age to respect elders/authority. </p>
      <h5>culture and religion</h5>
      <p>Kumoans place a heavy emphasis on education, both in terms of academic and physical. While the schools on Rho are considered the best in the region, Kumo has perhaps the largest amount of institutes despite being one of the smallest regions. While most institutes are all-encompassing, Kumoans also pride themselves on their creation of specialty schools for specialized training in specific fields.</p>
      <p>Kumoans are not particularly religious, although religious courses are taught across the region. There are few Kumoans that choose to pursue religious studies as well. Even with religion, Kumoans typically take a more logical approach, with fields like archaeology and history being more popular.</p>
      <h5>economy</h5>
      <p>Kumo's main exports include agriculture and highly specialized technology. Due to their closed off borders, they do not export goods often. They trade most frequently with Diyu, although even then, they choose mainly to import ships and trade routes are highly surveilled.</p>

        <p>Edan is the most diverse in terms of the species that habit it and geographical terrain with three mountain ranges, beachy areas, forests, and plains.</p>
        <h5>notable locations</h5>
<ul>
              <li>Terres, the new capital of Edan following the Last War. It is the most diverse location, with all species congregating. It has both residential areas, marketplaces, and a Central Temple.</li>
              <li>Massu, the old capital of Edan. Prior to the great war, it encompassed parts of Terres. It consists of mainly plains, and is home to various nomadic tribes.</li>
              <li>Azrelle, the most peaceful of the lands. It consists of plains, beaches, and a few scattered forests. It is the second most densely populated location after Terres and a popular tourism destination.</li>
              <li>Khamae, one of few places where it is eternally cold. The mountains block Khamae off from the rest of Edan, with the flatland region almost always covered in snow. It is not very highly populated, although there are rumors of Demon Coalition territories hidden in the mountains.</li>
              <li>Shivra, with mountains on the western front is mostly forest. It is habited by primarily Earth Nymphs in small agricultural villages. It has a few temple structures.</li>
              <li>Essandre, a mostly flatland territory with a few foresty parts. It hosts various villages, including a few that are inhabited primarily by migrated Demons.</li>
            </ul>
	</div>
      </div>
      <h5>social structures</h5>
<p>There is no cohesive political or social structure in Edan due to its size. However, most activity is centered in Terres while the other locations are primarily governed at the discretion of the residents. Terres is considered a middle ground for all six species, with laws regarding inter-regional trade all being decided in Terres.</p>
            <p>Edan is a host to quite a few different social structures outside of Terres, although the most prominent are village-cities that are governed at each one's discretion, nomadic tribes that wander from location to location, temple/religious cities inhabited primarily by religious figures, and sanctuary cities.</p>
      <h5>culture and religion</h5>
      <p>Since Edan is home to both religious and non-religious species, Terres observes many holidays. Other locations in Edan will often celebrate only select holidays under their specific Deity. </p>
      <h5>economy</h5>
      <p>Outside of Terres, Edan is primarily agricultural. Terres itself is a trade port for all other regions and thus also serves as a financial base. Edan trades the most frequently with all regions.</p>

<div class="card my-2 p-3">
  <h3>the species</h3>
  <div class="row no-gutters">
    <div class="col-md-5 p-1">
      <p>The Edanverse is inhabited by a total of 7 species: Sun Demons, Star Demons, Star Nymphs, Sea Nymphs, Sky Demons, Earth Nymphs, and Humans. While the three broad categories (Demons, Nymphs, Humans) have their similarities, each subspecie is further divided by their Affiliation, something many consider to date back to the days of the Elder Gods.</p>
      <h5>demons</h5>
      <p>Demons are the largest population in the Edanverse. While they are further divided by their respective affiliations, most demons have strong connections to the physical world and are very rooted beings.</p>
      <h5>nymphs</h5>
      <p>Nymphs are the smallest population in the Edanverse. While they are further divided by their respective affiliations, most nymphs have a strong connection to their own emotional state and are meditatitive beings.</p>
      <h5>humans</h5>
      <p>While human populations were previously low in the past, more emerged following the war. They are the only completely magickless beings and are very community-oriented as a result. While their base affiliation is always with the Earth (as a result of the Sun going mad with power), occasionally humans will find patronage under another deity (with very, very few falling under the Sun). They do not gain any powers under this switch.

          <p>Sun Demons are governed by emotion and are very passionate about every aspect of their life. However, this also means they are difficult to control during periods of negative emotions. Sun Demons have the highest control over magick, as they are able to summon flames at will. They primarily inhabit Diyu.</p>

          <p>Star Demons are larger and stronger than other species, with an average height of 6'0. However, due to their large physique, they are the only species with virtually no outward magickal ability. Magick in Star Demons manifest in somewhat faster healing and greater amounts of strength. Star Demons primarily inhabit Diyu and Venere; due to the end of war limiting Venerian territories, many have since migrated to Diyu.</p>

          <p>Star Nymphs have the largest amount of magickal potential, but they have the highest difficulty in controlling it. Star Nymphs are able to teleport, although not necessarily at will. They inhabit Kumo alongside Sky Demons.</p>

          <p>Sea Nymphs are governed by peace. Their magick is centered on visions, whether it be of the past or future, and knowledge. However, they are not very physically strong and their flora components are rather fragile. They inhabit Edan currently, although in the past they inhabited the now abandoned Dvar.</p>

          <p>Sky Demons are governed by senses and find deceit and trickery second nature. Sky magick is illusory magick; they are able to create extremely realistic holograms. More powerful Sky Demons are able to shapeshift, although the ability is learned after years in school. Sky Demons inhabit Kumo, alongside Star Nymphs.</p>

  <h3>the history</h3>
  <p>The Edanverse was, for the most part, a peaceful place up until what many call The Last War. While each region presents its own take on who started the war and why, the war ended up becoming a territorial dispute fought between various factions. There were four primary factions during the war:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Demon Alliance (Sun, Star, and Sky Demons)</li>
    <li>The Nymph Alliance (Sea and Earth Nymphs)</li>
    <li>Subdemons (Sun and Star Demons)</li>
    <li>The SDSN (Sun Demons and Star Nymphs)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ultimately, it was the SDSN Coalition that ended the war. As a result, the SDSN controlled much of the political landscape in the three years directly following the war. The SDSN was ultimately unable to maintain political control and, due to the frequent rebellions, a summit was held to create treaties between the species.</p>
  <p>Each region sent two representatives to discuss future alliances at the final summit. Organized and moderated by the SDSN, the main conclusions drawn from the summit were the ceding of 80% of Venerian land to Diyu, the closing of Kumo to outsiders, the migration of Star Nymphs from Venere to Kumo, and the construction of Terres, the capitol of Edan and a peace-zone for all five regions.</p>
  <p>The construction of Terres was again headed by the SDSN, which also installed a Central Council in Terres to prevent future disputes. While the Central Council, a diverse collection of region representatives and species representatives, eventually succeeded the SDSN as the primary political faction for the Edanverse, the SDSN continued to maintain economic control.</p>
